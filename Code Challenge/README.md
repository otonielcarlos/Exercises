Code Challenge
==============

In order to implement this component you'll have to follow this instructions:

1. Add the JavaScript file into the HTML file where you plan to implement this component: 
```<script src="app.js"></script>```

2. Create an input box with an "id='task'" : ```<input id="task">``` 

3. Create two buttons as follows:
    * ```<button id="add">Add To List</button>``` - This button will add anytime the text that we type on the input box, and display it inside an unordered list ```<ul></ul>```, unless nothing has been typed. Hit 'Enter' on the keyboard to add elements to the list as well.
    *```<button id="delete">Delete All</button>```- This button will delete everything inside the unordered list ```<ul></ul>```. Hit 'Escape' on the keyboard to delete all elements on the list as well.
    
4. The last, but not least, step is to create a form tag with an "id='todos'". In this element tag the unordered list ```<ul></ul>``` will be displayed whenever something is typed .

NOTE: Notice that next to every element inside the unordered list ```<ul></ul>``` there is a button that will delete that specific element when clicked.

This component can be used to build a To Do list web application.
